A challenge to myself, enocuraged by Michael Ballantyne.

Dan Friedman has long wanted a pattern-based macro system similar in
spirit to `syntax-rules`, but with *slightly* more power, such as the
ability to tell if part of a pattern is an identifier, or a number,
etc.  A type of limited "fender", to use the terminology of
`syntax-case`.  Michael thinks, after the `trs` term rewriting macro
experiments in `syntax-case`, I now know enough to attempt to build a
`syntax-case-plus-epsilon`.
